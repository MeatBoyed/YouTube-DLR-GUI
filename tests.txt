Be able to output all of the available resolutions
Use PyTube.streams to do this

Be able to download a video of a specific resolution.
Seen as you're not going higher than 720p for videos becuase of DASH. Just use PyTube. You can easily make clear filterson which stream you want and download speeds aren't too much of an issue.

Be able to show progress bar



Be able to change the name of the file with entered name param.
command: python -m youtube_dl -o [filename] [url]
-o states the output name of the file, must be followed by the desired video name.

Be able to change the download location with ented download location param.
command: python -m youtube_dl -o [path + filename] [url]

Use youtube-dl for downloading audio as it is considrably faster than PyTube


Every button call will always access the value inside the "videoURL" input.
After the video's url has been inputted, run a quick function to check that it's valid and can be downloaded. Maybe run also get all the availabele resolutions to the video and find a way to iterate over the list and output it with JS to
HTML.

Each download button for video, will take the inputted url's value and the filename along with download location, and use this data for download function params, also specifying the video's quality.
